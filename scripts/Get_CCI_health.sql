Description:        This query runs returns metadata regarding CCI health. The results are split by partition to provide a 
					granular understanding of the health of your index. 

					0 - UNKNOWN_UPGRADED_FROM_PREVIOUS_VERSION: Occurred when upgrading from the previous version of SQL Server.

- NO_TRIM: The row group was not trimmed. The row group was compressed with the maximum of 1,048,476 rows. The number of rows could be less if a subset of rows was deleted after delta rowgroup was closed

- BULKLOAD: The bulk-load batch size limited the number of rows.

- REORG: Forced compression as part of REORG command.

- DICTIONARY_SIZE: Dictionary size grew too large to compress all of the rows together.

- MEMORY_LIMITATION: Not enough available memory to compress all the rows together.

- RESIDUAL_ROW_GROUP: Closed as part of last row group with rows < 1 million during index build operation

- AUTO_MERGE: A Tuple Mover merge operation running in the background consolidated one or more rowgroups into this rowgroup.
