# SQL Style Guide

This is the SQL coding  best practices for formatting SQL that I’ve learned and used over the in large scale enterprise code base. 

When many programming languages, anyone can pretty much write statements as long as code fit the business requirments and the code will execute. Obviously there are some exceptions to this (such as indentations in Python) but that’s for another day. However, Data team
members working in database code development should follow the guideline for readability and reusability of their code.

## Formatting

When it comes to formatting, there are a number of things that should be considered such as intentions, alignment, comma positions, and text case.
For example of code that has been written and is quite unreadable if one or more following are in the SQL code. 

•	number of items per line
•	alignment issues
•	trailing commas
•	poor or lack of aliasing
•	lack of comments
•	grouping by number instead of name
•	position of aggregate functions in select statement
•	multiple hard to detect bugs

The better version of formatting is aligned to the left. All commas, spaces, and indentations make the code very easy to read.
